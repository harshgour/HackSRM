## Introduction

This is a decentralized web hosting solution using blockchain and IPFS.<br/>

## Problem Statement

The way web hosting works today is by hosting all the web content including textual content, code and media content on a centralized location which can then be accessed over the world wide web. But did you know? Your site is going to be down when there is server maintenance or if a load of the server gets high. Hosting of websites also becomes costly over a long period of time. To solve these issues we have implemented a decentralized web hosting solution where your website remains unaffected of server issues such as traffic, or maintainence.<br/>

## Solution
We have used IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to store our website in a peer-to-peer architecture. We have also introduced another system similar to DNS system for people to host their website on. Using this people can directly use name strings to view websites.<br/>
